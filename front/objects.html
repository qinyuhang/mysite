			<p class="ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-3">Our continuing mission</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-2">At Roux, our mission is to teach and inspire the next generation’s artists to create work that changes the way people think, and hopefully, even the way they act. We believe art inspires compassion by providing audiences with an empathetic outlet. We believe art informs and can advertise important messages. We believe it is our duty to show artists how to best use their tools and best communicate their message across. We exist to educate.</span></p>

			<p class="ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-2">Public transportation is plentiful in New York, so students are encouraged to not own a vehicle while enrolled. Parking is not provided for students and can be a significant financial burden. If you are traveling from the Kennedy airport (JFK), you can take a cab or arrange for car service to take you to Roux beforehand, for a fee of $40-$60. The AirTrain JFK service connects to the Howard Beach subway station, where you can take the A train into Manhattan and exit on the 34th Street stop. The one-way cost is $8.75.</span></p>
